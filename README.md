A fitness web application
We have included following features as a solution to our problem statement:

3. Yoga Training 
4. Workout Courses - Both for men and women
5. Fitness Tracker - Users can set their personalised goals and reminders. They can also download the progress report so as to share it on social     media
6. Calorie Tracker - User need to enter the food items they have eaten in a day. The app provides them with the total amount of calories they have consumed and if they will gain weight or not

Unique Features:
1. Body Specific Exercise - Male and Female have different body types and thus different exercises and workouts are meant for the. The user can click on the body part he/she wants to train and our application will provide the user with a list of exercises

2. Running/ Cycling Track Finder - Inspired from Pokemon Go idea, why not have a different walking/cycling track everytime you are out for exercise? These features provides the user with the possible destination he can cycle/walk to based on the input he/she has entered. The features relies upon the location of the user and provides suggestion based upon that.

3. Find a Friend - Tired of exercising all alone and need a company? This features allows the user to connect with other people using the application in surrounding areas, so that they can have a company while they jog, cycle or workout. This features also relies on the user's location.

4. Body Transformation Video - How about getting  your own body transformation video after months of harwork? The user is required to upload their post workout photo every time they workout, and after the selected time, the application will provide the user with their own body transformation video as an Surprise Element whichs shows their progress. Not only the users are motivated to work harder but they can also share this video online.
